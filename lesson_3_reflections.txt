When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my project, or when there are multiple people contributing to
    or developing the project, or when I am contributing an Open source Project myself,
    then I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To pull changes manually is better than automatic update of repository, because many
    times when I am adding a new feature to a software, there can be many commits necessary
    and pushing every commit to the remote Git repository is not neccessary as I might not want
    to include everything in the remote repository as it can be that one single commit may not
    always add the new feature or worse may include disfunctional features.
